## About Me
In 2013, he graduated from the Belarusian State University of Transport, specializing in the rolling stock of railway transport. From 2013 to 2015 I worked as a process engineer at BELAZ branch. From 2015 to the present time I have been working as a wagon fleet safety inspector on the Belarusian Railways.

At the moment my goal is to successfully complete the JS / FRONT-END course from The Rolling Scopes community, thereby gaining new knowledge, to improve the knowledge gained during self-education, to master a new profession.

## Skills
+ JS
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Git, GitHub
+ VS Code

## Code example
```JS
function checkBird() {
	let maxNumber = 0
	for (let i = 0; i < massX.length; i++) {
		if (massX[i] >= 410) {
			maxNumber = i + 1;
		}
		if (massX[i] <= 410 && massX[i] >= 380) {
			if (y - 10 < mass[i]) {
				gameInProgress = 0;
			}
			if (y + 10 > mass[i] + massHeight) {
				gameInProgress = 0;
			}
		}
	}
	score = maxNumber;
}
```
